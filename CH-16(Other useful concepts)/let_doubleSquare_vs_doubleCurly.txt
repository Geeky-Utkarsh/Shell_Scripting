Difference Between (( )), [[ ]], and let in Bash
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



1. (( )) (Double Parentheses)

Used for arithmetic evaluation.
Supports C-style arithmetic and assignments.
Returns 0 (true) or 1 (false) in conditions.

Example:
    if ((a > b)); then echo "a is greater"; fi



2. [[ ]] (Double Square Brackets)

Used for conditional testing with advanced features.
Supports logical operators and regex but not direct arithmetic.
Use $(( )) inside for arithmetic tests.

Example: 
      if [[ $a -gt $b ]]; then echo "a is greater"; fi



3. let

Used for arithmetic evaluation and silent assignments.
Can evaluate multiple expressions.
Less commonly used compared to (( )).

Example:
  let a=5+3 b=2*6
  echo $a $b  # Outputs: 8 12
