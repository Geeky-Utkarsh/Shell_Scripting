Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of grep, sed, and awk:



1. `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print)

- Purpose: Search for patterns in text.  
- Use Case: Find lines in a file or output that match a specific pattern.  
- Example:
        grep "error" logfile.txt  # Find lines containing "error"
  



2. `sed` (Stream Editor)
Purpose: Perform text transformations (substitute, delete, insert, etc.).  
Use Case: Modify or process text files programmatically.  
Example:  
  sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt  # Replace "foo" with "bar" globally in the file
  



3. `awk` (Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan)

Purpose: Pattern scanning and processing tool.  
Use Case: Process and analyze structured text (e.g., CSV, logs).  
Example:  
    awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt  # Print the 1st and 3rd columns of a file


Summary:
`grep`: Searches text.  
`sed`: Edits text.  
`awk`: Processes and extracts data.
