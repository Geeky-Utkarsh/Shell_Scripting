In Bash, there is no direct syntax for multiline comments like in some programming languages, but you can achieve it using the following methods:

---

### **1. Using `: ' ' ` (Colon Single Quotes)**
The `:` command is a no-op (does nothing), and the text inside single quotes is treated as a comment.

```bash
: '
This is a multiline comment
It can span multiple lines
and is ignored during execution
'
```

---

### **2. Using a Here Document**
A here document (`<<`) can redirect text to a command, and you can redirect it to `:` to ignore the text as a comment.

```bash
: << 'EOF'
This is another multiline comment
You can include multiple lines here
EOF
```

---

### **3. Commenting Each Line with `#`**
Manually prefix each line with `#`. While less elegant, it's a straightforward way.

```bash
# This is a multiline comment
# Each line starts with a hash symbol
# This is common practice in scripts
```

---

### **Recommendation**
The **`: ' ' ` method** is most commonly used for multiline comments in Bash scripts because it's clean and efficient.
